## How to install/manage dotfiles

I use the bare repository method for managing my dotfiles. See this [Atlassian article](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles) on managing dotfiles.

You can use my [bootstrapping script](https://github.com/txkyel/ubuntu-qtile-bootstrapper/blob/main/install.sh) to install my rice for Ubuntu.

### Kmonad

I followed [this](https://codebenchers.com/blog/kmonad-on-ubuntu-program-your-keyboard) tutorial for install Kmonad on Ubuntu with the released binaries.
